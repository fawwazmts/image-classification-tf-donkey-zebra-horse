# Image Classification Models using Tensorflow, Donkey vs Zebra vs Horse

## Description About Project

This project demonstrates how to build an image classification model usingTensorFlow. This model can classify three categories (“donkey”, “zebra”, or “horse”). This model is built by utilizing Image Augmentation and Transfer Learning. A pre-trained TF2 SavedModel from TensorFlow Hub is used for Transfer Learning.

## Infrastructure for Built Model

### Libraries

Model Machine Learning built with Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab. This Jupyter Notebook also can run in local. For development, the following are libraries which needs to be installed.

```
opendatasets==0.1.22

tensorflow==2.15.0
keras==2.15.0
tensorflow_hub==0.16.1

matplotlib==3.7.1
numpy==1.25.2

```

### Dataset

The data used to build this model was obtained from Kagle, that is [Donkeys, Horses &amp; Zebra Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifeanyinneji/donkeys-horses-zebra-images-dataset).
